## Synopsis

This is the beginning of a project to explore the possibility of using GPU javascript libraries to build computer-generated imagery.
I have a childhood love of tesselated imagery, so I'm beginning there :)

Eventually, I'll use this as a means of getting better at UI mechanics, and expanding my knowledge of various UI frameworks (initially targetting React/Redux and Vue).
